# Introducing: Nativ√© Engine
The powerful framework for creating web applications in php and js.

This framework is an application loader. You can create your application, based on already created. 
Engine for the web, but where is the web? The application `router` - the implementation of the template "MVC" with templates like Invision Community, for example, the web application "testapp" was created.

How it works? An application has been created for loading applications (paradox, yeah). Yes it is, but it is brilliant. You can create your application loader based on the `core` application.

For example, you can make a plugin loader for applications. Also, applications have dependencies. For example, a web application depends on `router` and `core`.
